## Project Overview
This project analyzes Fitbit daily activity and sleep logs to uncover usage patterns and derive actionable insights for **Bellabeat**, a smart wellness company.  
The analysis includes data cleaning, KPI computation, exploration, and visual storytelling.

**Objectives**
- Understand usersâ€™ daily steps and sleep behavior.  
- Identify weekday/weekly patterns and correlations.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for product and marketing.

---

## Data Source
Fitbit Fitness Tracker data (public Kaggle dataset).  
Period covered in the sample: **2016-04-12 to 2016-05-12**.  
Tables used include daily activity, sleep, and weight logs (weight used only where available).

> **Note:** The sample is small (~30 users / 31 days). Insights illustrate an approach rather than population-level conclusions.

---

## Methodology
- **Cleaning:** remove duplicates, standardize column names and dates, derive helper features (weekday, week).  
- **KPIs:** unique users, rows, median/mean steps, median/mean sleep (hours), correlation (steps vs. sleep).  
- **Exploration & Viz:** distribution of steps, steps Ã— sleep relationship, weekday and weekly trends, top users.  
- **Communication:** RMarkdown reports with Cosmo theme, floating TOC, and code folding.

---

## Key Findings
- Most users **did not reach 10,000 steps/day** on average.  
- **Sleep averages â‰ˆ 7 hours**, with considerable variability across days/users.  
- **Steps vs. sleep shows a weak negative correlation** in this sample.  
- Activity tends to **vary by weekday**; weekly medians fluctuate across ISO weeks.  
- Only a **subset** of users logged weight.

---

## Visual Highlights
- **Distribution of Daily Steps** â€“ long right tail with some very high-activity days.  
- **Sleep (hours) vs. Steps** â€“ weak linear trend, substantial scatter.  
- **Average Steps by Weekday** â€“ visible differences across days.  
- **Median Steps by ISO Week** â€“ week-to-week variability.  
- **Top 10 Users by Average Steps** â€“ leaderboard of the most active users.

## Recommendations
- Set **weekday-specific goals** and nudges to address variability.  
- Provide **sleep coaching nudges** after unusually high/low activity days.  
- Send **weekly summaries** to sustain engagement and highlight progress.

## Reproducibility
**Environment:** R (Posit/RStudio).  
**Core packages:** `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `janitor`, `here`, `skimr`, `scales`, `forcats`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`.

Install essentials:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse","lubridate","janitor","here","skimr","scales","forcats","knitr","rmarkdown"))
rmarkdown::render("bellabeat_advanced.Rmd", output_format = "html_document")
```
